# Hangman
Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or
sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of
guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.

# Project
This project is mainly to practice what I already know. I need to create a save/load feature in
a game of hangman. I will continue practing my separation of concerns and Object Oriented style
of programming.
